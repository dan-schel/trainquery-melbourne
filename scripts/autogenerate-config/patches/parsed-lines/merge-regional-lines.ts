// TODO: Merge regional lines like Echuca/Swan Hill/Bendigo together into a
// single line. Also merge in the suburban lines they share track with, but
// mark those stops as the "hidden-unless-stopped-at" type.
//
// This should have the side effect of fixing the bendigo line not realising
// patterns which stop at Watergardens and not Sunbury and vice-versa can be
// merged.

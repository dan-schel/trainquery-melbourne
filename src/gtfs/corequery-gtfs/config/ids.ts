// TODO: [DS] This is how IDs are expressed for Melbourne, using terms like
// suburban, regional, platforms, replacement bus, etc. I'd like to keep this

// corequery-gtfs which should obviously be agnostic to those terms and operate
// at the feed-level.

// Using terms like platforms, and replacment bus feels like a domain leak for
// corequery-gtfs. The concept of "certain GTFS ID means this position ID" is
// general enough, but calling it "platforms" is not. Same goes with the concept
// of "IDs we'll ignore" being called "replacement bus".
